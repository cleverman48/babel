[transform-class-properties]: You are using the "loose: true" option and you are explicitly setting a value for the "setPublicClassFields" assumption. The "loose" option can cause incompatibilities with the other class features plugins, so it's recommended that you replace it with the following top-level option:
	"assumptions": {
		"setPublicClassFields": true,
		"privateFieldsAsSymbols": true
	}
